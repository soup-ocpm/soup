# Easy Knowledge Graph
Project created for the Group Project exam of the third year of computer science in Camerino.

## Description
This project is based on the creation of a WebApp that allows the end user to create a graph <br>
starting from his data (event - log) saved in a .csv file with the aim of carrying out object-centric process-mining. <br>
All this occurs through the use of a Neo4j database which allows the saving of the generated data of interest.
Currently the system, in addition to carrying out the main purpose of creating graphs based on the data of interest, <br>
also allows the download of them in SVG format, the elimination of the data obtained in the corresponding Database of interest, <br>
as well as the possibility of performing groupings to optimize the overall usability of the results and the study of the data of interest.

### PM vs. Object-Centric PM
- Process Mining
Process mining is a discipline that is based on the use of data (generated by information systems) to extract useful information
offering a detailed and objective vision of company processes. This with the aim of visualizing, monitoring and above all optimizing the main activities.
Traditional process mining follows a plausible linear approach and can focus primarily on the flow of core process activities. <br>
However, this often leads to a limited vision, in which specific details or attributes may be overlooked and therefore not taken into consideration.
- Object-centric process mining emerged to address the limitation of traditional process mining just described.
This methodology focuses not only on the main activities of the process, but also on all entities involved and the attributes associated with them during the event.
Through object-centric it is possible to view the graph in detail and with all the attributes.

## Tecnhnologies
As previously described, to create the final project that satisfied all the requirements, 
various technologies were necessary which in turn were studied and explored in depth during the first weeks of development.

### 1. Neo4j Database
One of the fundamental technologies on which the main purpose of the project was based is certainly the Graph database. <br>
As a Graph database, the famous and professional Neo4j environment was used as requested.

### 2. Python
As regards the creation of the Backend server, the Python programming language was used as requested but above all Flask
which allows you to create Server applications for APIs. The Backend in this project is fundamental as it interacts through the 
use of libraries provided by Neo4j, with the Neo4j database in question, for the creation of graphs based on the end user's data. 
Obviously and temporarily the saving was made in a local Neo4j database.

### 3. Angular
The professional Angular framework was used as a frontend, therefore a fundamental part of the View, which allowed 
the application to be developed in a scalable and usable way. 
Within Angular, libraries have been used to create graphs based on nodes and relations.

and other library visible in package.json.

## Project Setup Guide
Complete explanation for project setup and correct start-up.

### Guide to different Branches
Within this repository, you can find two different Branches. 
<br>
The master represents the first version of the tool developed, using Neo4j as the database.<br>
The second branch, called "dev-megraph", would be version 2.0 of the project, which uses Memgraph as the Database. Furthermore, the interface is also different.<br> 
Previously (in the master branch), the generation of the EKG the user to directly view the complete graph, with the possibility of placing his studies and creating the Class graph. <br> 
Currently, this page in the "dev-memgraph" has been replaced with a "recap" page where a series of information is shown thanks to Cards. Here too in any case,<br> 
it is possible to create and view the Class graph.

### 1 - Database setup
As previously described, if you want to work with a Neo4j instance, simply clone the project and stay in the "master" branch. List of requirements necessary for the correct execution of the tool:

- Neo4j instance
First of all, it is necessary to have the Neo4j database (even locally), in case we are in the master branch. <br>
Here is the official guide for downloading Neo4j: [Download Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/download/)
- Memgraph instance
In case we want to work with Memgraph, clone the project and move to the "dev-memgraph" branch. <br> 
Here too, first of all it is necessary to have the Memgraph database (even locally).<br> 
Here is the official guide for downloading Memgraph: [Download Memgraph](https://memgraph.com/download) <br>
I recommend downloading Memgraph through Docker. Here is the official Docker guide: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
Here is the official guide to download Memgraph in Docker: [Download Memgraph in Docker](https://memgraph.com/docs/getting-started/install-memgraph/docker)

### 2 - Angular setup
In order to successfully start the Frontend project in Angular, you need to have the Angular CLI, to be able to start and create Angular projects.<br>
At this moment, both in both branches, the project has been developed with the following versions:

- Angular CLI: 15.2.9
- Node: 16.13.2
- NPM: 8.1.2


Once you have correctly configured the Angular CLI with the following versions, you can open the webapp project through your IDE, and run the following command in the terminal <br>
(inside the project root folder): **npm install** <br>
This will allow Angular to download all the necessary dependencies to be able to start the project correctly. <br>
Once the following operation is finished, we can run the following command to host the webapp locally: **ng serve**.<br>
This will allow Angular to build the tool and run it by default on port 4200. Example: **https://localhost:4200**

### 3 - Python setup
A key aspect for the smooth execution of your project is the correct configuration of data and database authentication in your Python code.<br>
Inside the "GraphController" folder, there are controllers responsible for interacting with the specified database.<br>
Database configurations are available at the top of these controller files.<br>
It is important to replace the default variables with your own database configurations.

Once you have correctly configured the entire environment, you can start everything necessary and use the tool.


## Final Product
The user has the possibility to upload his own .csv file containing the data of interest via Drag&Drop. 
Once the .csv file is loaded, the user has the possibility to filter the data and therefore the columns of his .csv file.
Once this operation has been done (optional) the Server will begin to create the Graph of interest through queries to the Neo4j Database
and will return the generated graph as a result. Obviously, the user has the possibility to download his graph in .svg format, as
the possibility of eliminating it, but above all grouping the entities by Classes, in such a way as to obtain a new graph of interest.
All this achieved thanks to the Neo4j, Python and Angular libraries and documentation.
