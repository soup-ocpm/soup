# Easy Knowledge Graph
Project created for the Group Project exam of the third year of computer science in Camerino.

## Description
This project is based on the creation of a WebApp that allows the end user to create a graph <br>
starting from his data (event - log) saved in a .csv file with the aim of carrying out object-centric process-mining. <br>
All this occurs through the use of a Neo4j database which allows the saving of the generated data of interest.
Currently the system, in addition to carrying out the main purpose of creating graphs based on the data of interest, <br>
also allows the download of them in SVG format, the elimination of the data obtained in the corresponding Database of interest, <br>
as well as the possibility of performing groupings to optimize the overall usability of the results and the study of the data of interest.

### PM vs. Object-Centric PM
- Process Mining
Process mining is a discipline that is based on the use of data (generated by information systems) to extract useful information
offering a detailed and objective vision of company processes. This with the aim of visualizing, monitoring and above all optimizing the main activities.
Traditional process mining follows a plausible linear approach and can focus primarily on the flow of core process activities. <br>
However, this often leads to a limited vision, in which specific details or attributes may be overlooked and therefore not taken into consideration.
- Object-centric process mining emerged to address the limitation of traditional process mining just described.
This methodology focuses not only on the main activities of the process, but also on all entities involved and the attributes associated with them during the event.
Through object-centric it is possible to view the graph in detail and with all the attributes.

## Tecnhnologies
As previously described, to create the final project that satisfied all the requirements, 
various technologies were necessary which in turn were studied and explored in depth during the first weeks of development.

### 1. Neo4j Database
One of the fundamental technologies on which the main purpose of the project was based is certainly the Graph database. <br>
As a Graph database, the famous and professional Neo4j environment was used as requested.

### 2. Python
As regards the creation of the Backend server, the Python programming language was used as requested but above all Flask
which allows you to create Server applications for APIs. The Backend in this project is fundamental as it interacts through the 
use of libraries provided by Neo4j, with the Neo4j database in question, for the creation of graphs based on the end user's data. 
Obviously and temporarily the saving was made in a local Neo4j database.

### 3. Angular
The professional Angular framework was used as a frontend, therefore a fundamental part of the View, which allowed 
the application to be developed in a scalable and usable way. 
Within Angular, libraries have been used to create graphs based on nodes and relations.

- [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [Dagre-d3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dagre-d3)
and other library visible in package.json.

## Final Product
The user has the possibility to upload his own .csv file containing the data of interest via Drag&Drop. 
Once the .csv file is loaded, the user has the possibility to filter the data and therefore the columns of his .csv file.
Once this operation has been done (optional) the Server will begin to create the Graph of interest through queries to the Neo4j Database
and will return the generated graph as a result. Obviously, the user has the possibility to download his graph in .svg format, as
the possibility of eliminating it, but above all grouping the entities by Classes, in such a way as to obtain a new graph of interest.
All this achieved thanks to the Neo4j, Python and Angular libraries and documentation.
